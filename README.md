# Random Password Maker & Strength Analyzer

This project is a comprehensive tool developed in a Jupyter Notebook for generating strong, random passwords and analyzing their strength using machine learning models.

## 🌟 Key Features

-   **Interactive UI:** A user-friendly interface built with `ipywidgets` for a seamless experience.
-   **Random Password Generator:** Creates passwords based on user-specified criteria (length, number of letters, numbers, and symbols).
-   **ML-Powered Strength Analysis:** Automatically evaluates the strength of any password (generated or manually entered) using trained models.
-   **Dual-Model Prediction:** Utilizes both **Logistic Regression** and a highly accurate **Random Forest Classifier** to categorize passwords as Weak, Medium, or Strong.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Algorithms Used

-   **Language:** Python
-   **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
-   **Core Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, ipywidgets.
-   **Algorithms:**
    -   Logistic Regression
    -   Random Forest Classifier
